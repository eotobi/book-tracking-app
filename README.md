# Book Tracking App
A website for tracking book reading.
On this website, users should be able to:

Add a new book entry with just a title.
Transition a book to the "reading" state.
Move a book to the "to-read" column.
Shift a book to the "completed" column.
Delete any book entry.
Book Entry should only contain book title and nothing else. There is no need to add editing functionality.

For this task, you're required to craft both a frontend (using NextJS) and a backend (with Python + FastAPI).

#### Build the entire stack with


```bash
docker-compose up -d

```
#### then

```bash
start http://localhost:3000
```

#### if 'start' cannot be found copy the link http://localhost:3000 on your browser
